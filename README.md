# SMART GLOVE FOR DEAF & DUMB PEOPLE
___

Many people throughout the world experience varying degrees of disability due to the loss of their capacity to talk and hear, which can be brought on by either a car or workplace accident or several diseases. These people cannot perform daily tasks after losing communication. Those people may also experience psychological effects in addition to the aforementioned difficulties. In order to enable speech-impaired people to interact with others regularly, in this project we introduced a method for achieving multiple sign language translation using a sensors-based glove and an Android smartphone.
